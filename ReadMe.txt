The Setting of my game is that when you are walking around your house you notice that your pet dragon Draco is missing. If he gets out he will devour all the sheep in the land.

A puzzle that I experimented with was using a NPC to get in the way of the player from completing the game.

The rooms are the living room, Kitchen, bedroom, basement, Training room.
Some objects are The Dragon cage, Pair of Dragon Gloves, and money.

I learned how to make a NPC. I wanted something to interact with the player to make it more interesting so I created a NPC butler to communicate with the player. I figured it out because someone showed me the code for a NPC.

A resource that helped me learning inform is other code from games and the wiki page made by Mrs.Kiang.
